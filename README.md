# AdventOfOCaml2020
My Advent of Code 2020 solutions in OCaml.

Each day has a separate folder contained in the lib directory.


I have been running my programs in [utop](https://github.com/ocaml-community/utop) for the most part.
You will also need to use Jane Street's [Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core), as I enjoy using it as my standard library. 

If you decide to use utop be aware that I occasionally make use of `ppx_jane`, so for some file `#use`'s you may need to `#require ppx_jane`.
